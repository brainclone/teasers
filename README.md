Brain Teasers Collection
My attempts on some brain teasers. They are put here to assist people interested in such problems, not to spoil the fun. So I would recommend give your brain a workout first before jumping into the code.

1. kth
    Select the Kth smallest (largest) number in n sorted arrays. The file `kth.js` includes functions to get first k smallest/largest number in 2 sorted arrays, the exact kth number in 2 arrays, and in n arrays.
