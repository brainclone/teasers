Brain Teasers Collection  

My attempts on some brain teasers. They are put here to assist people interested in such problems, not to spoil the fun. So I would recommend giving your brain a workout before jumping into the code.

See the REAME.md file in respective folders for details.

1. kth
    Select the Kth smallest (largest) number in n sorted arrays. The file `kth.js` includes functions to get first k smallest number in 2 sorted arrays, the exact kth number in 2 arrays, and in n arrays.

2. coins: 2 prolbems with coins (arbitrary sum and coin taking strategy)
3. life: game of life update function with space saving in mind.
4. treasure hunt: 2008 google treasure hunt problems (3 out of 4).
